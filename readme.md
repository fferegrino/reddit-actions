# Reddit Actions

This is a repo that contains a simple Python tool that iterates through your saved Reddit threads and allows you to perform actions on them.

## Setup

### Reddit API Credentials

You need to create a Reddit API application and get the credentials.

1. Go to [Reddit Developer](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
2. Click "Create App" at the bottom of the page
3. Fill in the form and click "Create App"
4. Copy the client ID and client secret

Set them as environment variables before running the script.

```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_username
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Instapaper API Credentials

You don't need much to use Instapaper's API, just your username and password.

```
INSTAPAPER_USER=your_username
INSTAPAPER_PASS=your_password
```
